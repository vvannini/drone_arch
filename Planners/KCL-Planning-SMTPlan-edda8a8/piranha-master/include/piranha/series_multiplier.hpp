/// Series multiplier.
/**
 * This class is used by the multiplication operators involving two series operands. The class works as follows:
 *
 * - an instance of series multiplier is created using two series as construction arguments;
 * - when operator()() is called, an instance of \p Series is returned, representing
 *   the result of the multiplication of the two series used for construction.
 *
 * Any specialisation of this class must respect the protocol described above (i.e., construction from series
 * instances and operator()() to compute the result). Note that this class is guaranteed to be used after the symbolic
 * arguments of the series used for construction
 * have been merged (in other words, the two series have identical symbolic arguments sets).
 *
 * The default implementation of this class does not define any call operator: any use of this class will thus result in
 * a compile-time error.
