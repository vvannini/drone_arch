# PROST's RDDL Parser
This repository contains a compilable RDDL (https://github.com/ssanner/rddlsim) parser using flex and bison.

The code was extracted from PROST's Planner repository (https://bitbucket.org/tkeller/prost/overview) and added here to be used with ROSPlan (https://github.com/KCL-Planning/ROSPlan).

Using a slightly modified version of the parser from PROST's commit 33a8f41 (2018-09-14).
